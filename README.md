# OpenClassrooms-P4-Instagrid

Welcome to Instagrid!

Instagrid is an iOS app that lets you select and combine photos within a stylish frame.  
You can easily save your creations on your iPhone.

As the fourth project in the OpenClassrooms curriculum, Instagrid is the first one running on a real device with custom views.  
I've learned valuable skills like UIStackViews, UIButtons, UISwipeGestureRecognizer, and more.

Join me in exploring the creative possibilities of Instagrid and share your feedback on this exciting project!
